# Bits2Bytes 

**Bits2Bytes Labs** is an open-source educational initiative focused on hands-on learning in **Embedded Systems, Robotics, and IoT**.

The goal of this project is to provide **structured, practical, and lab-driven content** that helps learners progress from fundamental concepts (bits, logic, pins) to real-world systems and applications (bytes, protocols, and complete solutions).
